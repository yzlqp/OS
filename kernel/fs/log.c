 * Log write: Writes the contents of the transaction (TxB, metadata block, and data block) to the log and waits for these writes to complete. 
 * Log Commit: The transaction commit block (including TxE) is written to the log, and once completed, we consider the transaction to have committed successfully. 
 * Add checkpoint: Writes transactions (metadata and data updates) from the log to the final location on disk. 
 * Release: After a period of time, update the log superblock to mark completed checkpointed transactions as idle.
